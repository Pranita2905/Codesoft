## Introduction

This repository contains Java programming tasks completed as part of my internship at CodSoft. The tasks focus on various core Java concepts, object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and interactive applications.

## Task 1: ATM Interface

### Description

The ATM Interface simulates the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Users can interact with the system to:

- Check their balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Exit the ATM session

The project emphasizes fundamental Java concepts such as classes, objects, loops, and conditionals.

### File
- `ATM_INTERFACE.java`

## Task 2: Number Game

### Description

The Number Game is an interactive game where users must guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The system provides feedback on whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target, encouraging the user to try again until they get it right.

This project focuses on using Java loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

### File
- `Number_Game.java`

## Task 3: Student Grade Calculator (GUI)

### Description

The Student Grade Calculator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to calculate a student's grade based on their performance in various subjects. The project demonstrates the use of Java Swing to build a user-friendly interface and perform calculations.

### File
- `Student_Grade_Calculator_GUI.java`

## Features

- **ATM Interface**: Basic banking features such as balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal.
- **Number Game**: Interactive guessing game with real-time feedback.
- **Student Grade Calculator**: A GUI-based application for calculating student grades with ease.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used for all projects.
- **Java Swing**: Used in the Student Grade Calculator project to create a GUI.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Applied across all projects.
